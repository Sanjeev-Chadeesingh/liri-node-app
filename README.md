# liri-node-app
SYNOPSIS:
This is an application that uses node originated API calls to provide information through a command line interface.

THE GROWING NEED FOR UNIQUELY SUITED INFORMATION:
The ability to access mass quantities of information is now possible for anyone, and naturally, there is a growing need for this information to be uniquely gathered and sorted to cater to an individual's singular interests. Few people know what APIs are or how to utilize them, so necessarily, the delivery of said specified data is under constant optimization. There is no catch-all application or service that could possibly supply every curious person with precisely what they are looking for, and the number of customized inquiries people make will only increase as more material is put online to access. If that increase is coupled with the relatively static and low number of people who can use APIs to access data, then the LIRI application's reason for creation should be self-explanatory. LIRI enhances people's basic search capabilities, powering individual queries with API-sourced answers regarding entertainment. Be it movies or music,and whether the music is live or not, LIRI provides its users with simple, readable responses to their queries for music and movies.
